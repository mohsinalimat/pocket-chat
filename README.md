## Overview

Pocket Chat is our way of chat-room texting on the blockchain. We have created a chatroom (via Smart Contract) on the AION and Ethereum test networks that allows you to talk to any users connected to it. 

It is built utilizing the [Pocket Core MVP](https://docs.pokt.network/docs/whats-pocket-mvp) to dispatch and relay the requests to its desired network.

If you are an early tester and want to give Product Feedback.

Please create an issue within this GitHub repo utilizing the label "Product Feedback", write a concise description of the problem or idea. If you can add a screenshot that will be more helpful.

The issues will curate development backlog for the team to get to when time permits.

The Pocket Core team is now focused on delivering the Testnet release so non-trivial updates to Monster Chase may take additional time. Since the code is open source anyone who would like to contribute to feature adds or updates is welcome too.
